# UpCycle Connect ♻️

## Problem Statement
Every year, industrial units and academic laboratories discard large amounts of reusable materials such as metal scraps, containers, timber offcuts, and electronic components.  
Most of this waste ends up in landfills not because it lacks value, but because there is no simple, trusted system to redistribute it locally.

This results in:
- Increased environmental pollution
- Wastage of usable resources
- Limited access to affordable materials for students and innovators

---

## Our Solution
**UpCycle Connect** is a hyper-local digital marketplace designed to enable the reuse of industrial and laboratory surplus materials.

The platform connects **industries and labs** that generate surplus materials with **students, innovators, and recycling startups**, allowing materials to be reused safely and sustainably.  
By promoting local redistribution, UpCycle Connect reduces environmental impact while encouraging innovation and circular economy practices.
